# 🗺️ Run-to-Own

**Tagline:** _Turn every step into ownership—Run, Compete, and Conquer!_

Run-to-Own is a Spring Boot-powered, Strava-integrated fitness app that gamifies your running experience by transforming GPS-tracked activities into digital territory conquest, point accumulation, and leaderboard competition.

---

## 🌟 Core Concept

Imagine your city as a grid of conquerable tiles. Every run you complete on Strava syncs with Run-to-Own, converting GPS paths into territorial claims. First to run a tile? You own it. Someone else runs more than you in that tile? Turf war begins.
